# ü§ñ FLIP7-DEALERBOT

A modified version of the Crunchlabs Dealerbot firmware designed to play the card game **FLIP7**. This code allows you to play with up to 8 players using the Hack Pack DEALR BOT.

## Key Features & Changes

This project is based on the modularized UNO code from WKoA. To adapt it for FLIP7 and optimize it for an Arduino Nano, I've made the following changes:

* **üÉè Added Game Logic:** The `games` folder now contains the complete logic for FLIP7.
* **üß† Memory Optimized:** To fit on an Arduino Nano, all other games and unused functions from the original `.ino` file have been removed.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Code Refactored:** Some of the main dealer code has been refactored to use less memory.
* **üß© CAD Files Included:** Includes a 3D printable insert to adapt the dealer for the narrower FLIP7 cards.
* **üë• Up to 8-Players:** Firmware and instructions are included to expand the game for up to 8 players.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the game running on your Dealerbot.

1.  **Download the Code**
    * Click the green `Code` button on this page and select `Download ZIP`, or clone the repository.

2.  **Setup Arduino IDE**
    * Follow the setup instructions provided on a post in the Crunchlabs Discord.
    * > **Note:** The following Discord link is only accessible to members of the Crunchlabs Discord server. [Link to Arduino Setup Instructions](https://discord.com/channels/1229106258749948056/1367718391196029030/1367718391196029030).

3.  **Upload to Dealerbot**
    * Open the `Flip7DealerMain.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
    * Connect your Dealerbot and upload the sketch.

## üñ®Ô∏è Hardware Modifications

### Card Tray Adapter
FLIP7 cards are narrower than standard playing cards. To ensure they deal correctly:
* 3D print the `.stl` file located in the `/CAD` folder.
* Place the printed insert into the dealer's card tray.
* **Only place about half of the deck in the dealer at a time.** The weight of a full deck can cause dealing issues.

### Expanding to 8 Players
To play with more than four players, you will need to create new colored player tags.
* An `.stl` file for new tags was created by `belugafan` on the Crunchlabs Discord. [Link to Tag .stl File](https://discord.com/channels/1229106258749948056/1366237526259531858).
* Modify the `ColorNames.h` file as instructed in the file's comments to define your new colors. The 8 colors currently in the file are a good starting point.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERY IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è
> After changing the colors in `ColorNames.h`, you **must** retune the dealer's color sensor through the built-in tuning menu for the new tags to be recognized correctly.

## üé≤ How to Play

The general gameflow and score tallying is managed by the Dealerbot.

### Game Setup
1.  **Power On:** Turn on the Dealerbot. It will initialize and ask you to place the player tags.
2.  **Start Game:** Select the FLIP7 game from the menu. The Dealer will have you confirm the score to play to.
3.  **Register Players:** The Dealer will spin around and scan all player tags to determine the number of players for the game.

### Playing a Round
4.  **Initial Deal:** One card is dealt to each player. Each player must confirm if you received a special card (e.g., Freeze or Flip3).
5.  **Special Cards:** When a special card is received, the Dealer will ask you who to apply it to.
6.  **Take Your Turn:** When it's your turn, the Dealer will ask if you want to **Hit** (take a card) or **Stand**.
7.  **Report Outcome:** After choosing to Hit, follow the screen prompts to report the result: "Bust", "Special Card", "Seven Cards", or "Continue to next player".
8.  **Round End:** The round continues until all players have either stood, busted, been frozen, or received 7 cards.

### Scoring & Winning
8.  **Enter Score:** After the round, the Dealer will turn to each player to have them enter their score.
9.  **Check for Winner:** The first player to achieve the score set at the start of the game wins! If there is no winner yet, the Dealer will begin a new round.
